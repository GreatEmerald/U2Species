DESCRIPTION
-----------

Unreal II Species is a package that changes players' attributes in many ways. Here are the features of this package:
1. Unreal II footstep sounds. All of the sounds are supported, and a few extra sounds are added for anyone who wants to convert maps from Unreal II or simply create other materials than the default ones.
2. Unreal II landing sounds. Each surface you land on now causes a different kind of sound when you land on it.
3. Falling sounds. When you fall, you now scream instead of showing no emotions whatsoever.
4. Unreal II hit and death sounds. Depending on the species you choose, you get different hit and death shouts.
5. Integration with Unreal II Voice Pack and Unreal II Soldier & Skaarj models. Using this Species package with the mentioned mods you can make bots and players that look like if they just came from Unreal II world!
6. Integration with Species Stats Plus mutator. Each species are subclasses of current species, so Heavy will be less vulnerable to attack while Light will be faster if using Species Stats Plus even out of the box!

KNOWN ISSUES
------------
